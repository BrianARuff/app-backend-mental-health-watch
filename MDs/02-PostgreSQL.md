### **Setting Up database by the CLI**
1. `postgres psql`
2. `CREATE DATABASE test;`
3. `\c test`

---

### **Create table in PSQL**
```
CREATE TABLE test (
    name varchar(30),
    age smallint
  );
```

---

### **Inserting into Database with psql**

```
INSERT INTO test(name, age)
VALUES ('Brian', 30);
```

---

### **Search all results in table with psql**

```
SELECT * FROM test;

```

### [Full Text Search](https://www.compose.com/articles/mastering-postgresql-tools-full-text-search-and-phrase-search/)

##### Note: Perform Magical Search Operations with the Following
1. `to_tsvector` 
    - creates a list of tokens. The `ts` in `to_tsvector` stands for text search.
2. `to_tsquery`
    - quries the token list generated by `to_tsvector` by looking through certain words that have been indexed.

3. If you were to run `to_tsvector` on the text **"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog."**
     - It would return a list with results something like: 
  ### **{ **"quick": 2**, **"brown": 3**, **"fox": 4**, **"jumped": 5**, **"lazy": 8**, **"dog": 9** }**
  - But wait there is more, it sorts it alphabetically as well like such!!
    - {"brown": 3 "dog": 9 "fox": 4 "jumped": 5 "lazy": 8 "quick": 2}
    - Note that the numbers are the index of the order the word appears in the original sentence.
  - There is even more magic happening though.
      - `to_tsvector`, by default, ***lexeme*** each indexed word, so the result object is now this:
        - {"brown": 3, "dog": 9, "fox": 4, "***jump***": 5, "***lazi***": 8 "quick": 2}.
         - jumped was switched to jump and lazy was switched to lazi. This all happens based on the localization of your postgresql setup.
```
SELECT * FROM test
WHERE to_tsvector(description) @@ to_tsquery('string value to search here');
```

---

### **Alter** Table and **ADD** Column with psql query

```
  ALTER TABLE test
  ADD COLUMN description text NOT NULL;
 ```
ddThe column description will be of type text and will be required because it's not allowed to be a null value.

---

### **Drop** Column from table

```
ALTER TABLE test
DROP COLUMN description;
```

### **Drop Entire Table ðŸ¤•ðŸ¥Š**

```
DROP TABLE test
```
